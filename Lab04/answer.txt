1. The resulting appearances of the applications developed using Swing and AWT might be different as well. Make comparisons.
=> ans:
- Top-Level Containers
    + AWT: Uses platform-dependent containers like Frame, Dialog, and Applet. The appearance varies across operating systems.
    + Swing: Uses lightweight containers like JFrame, JDialog, and JApplet. Consistent appearance and highly customizable.

- Component Class Names
    + AWT: Examples include Button, TextField, Checkbox, Panel.
    + Swing: Adds "J" prefix, such as JButton, JTextField, JCheckBox, JPanel. Swing introduces additional components like JTable, JTree.

- Event Handling
    + AWT: Older event-handling mechanism, less flexible. Not thread-safe.
    + Swing: Modern event-handling with detailed listeners and better thread safety using SwingUtilities.invokeLater().

- Appearance
    + AWT: Relies on the native OS look and feel, limiting customization.
    + Swing: Consistent appearance with multiple themes and extensive customization options.
